#Almost Frogger!

## 1. Project Overview

A frogger-esque 2D birds-eye view obstacle based game. The user will start at one side
of the window and will have to navigate to the other side to advance a level. There will
be a certain amount of lives allotted and any collision with obstacles or enemies will
decrease the lives the Player has. The game will involve keyboard input, cinder-based
animation and movement, and a simple graphical display.

## 2. Motivation and Background

I have previously worked on a 2D platformer using C# and Unity as a senior group project
in my senior year independent study CS class. This gave me some basic game design
mechanics and strategies. This project will be the first time that I will be applying the
knowledge I gained from that project to an entirely new project that is developed
solely by myself and that is an experience I am looking forward to.
